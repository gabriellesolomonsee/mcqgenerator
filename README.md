The MCQ Generator is an app to help generate MCQ papers with a consistent format.

MVP: Able to
show a form to accept information about the paper
add it into the database (MongoDB)
display a list of papers created
show information about one paper and the option to view questions and answers for this paper
edit the paper and questions in it with forms
update one paper and individual questions in it
delete the paper or individual questions if necessary
Disploying it to Heroku for public usage

This project used NodeJS, Express, MongoDB (Mongo Atlas), and EJS.

Problem faced include dificulties connecting to the database and deploying to Heroku after some amendments.

Future improvements:
Login function with session
Output the MCQ papers into PDF format for mass printing
Aesthetics
